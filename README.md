## Denizen scripting with BreweryX

This repository is meant to showcase the available features through BreweryX with Depenizen. There is currently a [PR](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Depenizen/pull/430) open for this.

In the meantime, you can compile [our fork of Depenizen](https://github.com/BreweryTeam/Depenizen) yourself or use a pre-compiled binary on our [releases tab](https://github.com/BreweryTeam/BreweryDenizenScripts/releases).
